# WTweg

## Why no support?

> * Designed for own personal usage, thus no issue reports/pull requests.
> * Prefer to do all code, at own pace, in own time.
> * See [this](https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/docs/v30/#faq-opensource) for ideas why no collab.

## Why?

> * **Because I am petty enough to do things for myself, my way.**
> * Experiment with things outside of "emulation" like:
>   - Compression.
>   - Audio DSP/synthesis.
>   - Graphics rendering.
>   - Software reverse engineering.

## Where?

> [A list of tested cores is here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mudl0rd/WTweg/master/cores.txt)
>
> [Cores can be grabbed here](http://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/windows/x86_64/latest/)
> * "cores" is where all libretro cores go. Cores can be left as-is from buildbot, no need to unzip.
> * "saves" is where all saves are.
> * "system" is where all BIOSes/system files go.
> 
> * "Emulation General" and "Myrient" are useful resources. Use them.

## With?

> * [Dynamic rate control](https://docs.libretro.com/development/cores/dynamic-rate-control/).
> * Support for GL-based libretro cores.
> * Support for contentless libretro cores (like game engine reimplementations)
> * Savestates/SRAM saving/loading.
> * [dear-imgui based UI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
> * Commandline support for debugging cores with GDB.
> * Per-game settings per-core.
> * Multiple controller support.
> * Drag-and-drop loading support for ROMs/ISOs, automatically choosing needed cores.

## How?

> * OGL4.6 (Windows/Linux), OGLES3 (RPI4/5)
> * SSE4.2/AVX2 (Windows/Linux), NEON (RPI4/5)
> * SDL2
> * dear-imgui
> * Meson
> * MSYS2 (Windows), GCC/G++ (Linux/RPI)
> * Visual Studio Code
